📊 Streamlit-Based Inventory & Sales Prediction Dashboard

🔍 Project Overview

I created this interactive inventory and sales analytics dashboard to showcase how Streamlit can be leveraged to build user-friendly and real-time business intelligence tools. Many MSMEs (Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises) struggle with manual inventory tracking and sales forecasting—this project simplifies the process by allowing users to upload CSV or SQL files and instantly gain actionable insights into their business performance.

🚀 Why Streamlit?

Streamlit makes it easy to build and deploy interactive dashboards without the complexity of traditional web development. This dashboard enables small businesses to:
✅ Track inventory levels in real-time
✅ Analyze sales trends with engaging visualizations
✅ Leverage AI-powered forecasting for data-driven decisions
✅ Identify waste and optimize restocking strategies
